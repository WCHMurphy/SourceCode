please make sure you run the system using a XAMP Server : 

tep 1: Download and Install XAMPP
Download XAMPP: Go to the Apache Friends website and download the XAMPP installer for your operating system (Windows, Linux, or MacOS).
Install XAMPP: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Default settings are usually fine for most users.
Launch XAMPP Control Panel: After installation, open the XAMPP Control Panel from your applications or programs list.
Step 2: Start Apache and MySQL
Start Apache and MySQL: In the XAMPP Control Panel, click on the ‘Start’ buttons next to Apache and MySQL. Apache is your web server, and MySQL is your database server.
Check Status: Ensure both Apache and MySQL are running. They should be highlighted in green in the XAMPP Control Panel.
Step 3: Place Your PHP Website
Locate htdocs Folder: Find the htdocs folder in your XAMPP installation directory (usually C:\xampp\htdocs on Windows).
Create a Project Folder: Inside htdocs, create a new folder for your project, e.g., mywebsite.
Copy Your PHP Files: Copy all your PHP website files and paste them into this new folder (mywebsite).
Step 4: Access Your Website
Open a Web Browser: Launch your preferred web browser.
Type Localhost Address: In the address bar, type localhost/mywebsite (replace mywebsite with the name of your project folder).
View Your Site: Your PHP website should now be displayed in the browser.
